# formula1-statistics-database
Analyze public formula1 data published on ergast/fastf1 API with Oracle Express/Free edition-

I'm currently rebuilding my formula1 statistical database using some more modern Oracle technics
that will speed up the handling of loading and generate statistical data and make installation much easier.
In the meantime use the oracle-f1-stats-db repo until noticed.
